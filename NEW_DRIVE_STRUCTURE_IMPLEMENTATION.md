# New Google Drive Structure Implementation

## 🎯 Implementation Summary

**Request**: "All invoices (from both the inviter's own email and the invited/connected emails) should be saved in the inviter's Google Drive, not in the connected email's Drive. Updated Folder Structure in Google Drive should be like this: A main folder named 'Invoice Manager'. Inside it, a folder named 'Invoices'. Inside 'Invoices', create a folder for the email address being scanned. Inside the email folder, create 12 subfolders (one for each month, named by month). Inside each month's folder, create subfolders for vendor names. Inside each vendor's folder, store the actual invoice PDFs."

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED**

## 🔧 Changes Made

### **1. Created InviterService**
**File**: `backend/services/inviter_service.py`

```python
class InviterService:
    @staticmethod
    async def get_inviter_user_for_email_account(email_account_id: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Find the inviter user for a given email account"""
        
    @staticmethod
    async def get_inviter_user_for_email_address(email_address: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Find the inviter user for a given email address"""
        
    @staticmethod
    async def get_all_invited_email_accounts_for_user(user_id: str) -> list:
        """Get all email accounts that were invited by a specific user"""
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Inviter Detection**: Automatically finds the inviter user for any email account
- ✅ **Own Account Handling**: Handles cases where the account owner is the inviter
- ✅ **Invitation Tracking**: Tracks invitation relationships properly
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging

### **2. Updated DriveService with New Folder Structure**
**File**: `backend/services/drive_service.py`

#### **New Folder Structure Methods**:
```python
def create_invoice_manager_folder(self, inviter_user_id: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Create or get main 'Invoice Manager' folder for inviter user"""

def create_invoices_folder(self, inviter_user_id: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Create or get 'Invoices' folder inside Invoice Manager"""

def create_email_folder(self, inviter_user_id: str, email_address: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Create or get email-specific folder inside Invoices"""

def create_month_folder(self, inviter_user_id: str, email_address: str, month_name: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Create or get month-specific folder inside email folder"""

def create_vendor_folder_in_month(self, inviter_user_id: str, email_address: str, month_name: str, vendor_name: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Create or get vendor-specific folder inside month folder"""
```

#### **New Save Method**:
```python
async def save_scanned_email_invoice_new_structure(self, email_account_id: str, vendor_name: str, email_data: Dict, invoice_info: Dict, local_file_info: Optional[Dict] = None, scanned_email: str = None) -> Optional[Dict]:
    """Save scanned email invoice to inviter's Google Drive with new folder structure"""
```

#### **Month Name Extraction**:
```python
def get_month_name_from_date(date_str: str) -> str:
    """Get month name from date string (e.g., '2025-01-15' -> 'January_2025')"""
```

### **3. Updated InvoiceProcessor**
**File**: `backend/services/invoice_processor.py`

#### **Updated PDF Invoice Processing**:
```python
# OLD: Used connected email's Drive
drive_file_info = drive_service.save_scanned_email_invoice(
    user_id, vendor_name, email_data, gemini_result, local_file_info, scanned_email
)

# NEW: Uses inviter's Drive with new structure
drive_file_info = await drive_service.save_scanned_email_invoice_new_structure(
    email_account_id, vendor_name, email_data, gemini_result, local_file_info, scanned_email
)
```

#### **Updated Text Invoice Processing**:
```python
# OLD: Used connected email's Drive
drive_file_info = drive_service.save_scanned_email_invoice(
    user_id, vendor_name, email_data, invoice_info, None
)

# NEW: Uses inviter's Drive with new structure
drive_file_info = await drive_service.save_scanned_email_invoice_new_structure(
    email_account_id, vendor_name, email_data, invoice_info, None, scanned_email
)
```

## 📁 New Folder Structure

### **Before (Old Structure)**:
```
uploads/
└── invoices/
    └── {user_id}/
        └── {vendor_name}/
            └── invoice.pdf
```

### **After (New Structure)**:
```
Invoice Manager/
└── Invoices/
    └── {email_address}/
        └── {month_year}/
            └── {vendor_name}/
                └── invoice.pdf
```

### **Example Structure**:
```
Invoice Manager/

## 🔍 How It Works

### **1. Invoice Processing Flow**
```
Email Scanned → Find Inviter → Create Folder Structure → Save Invoice
      ↓              ↓                ↓                    ↓
   Parse Email   InviterService   DriveService        Upload PDF
   Content      (Find Owner)     (Create Folders)    (Save File)
```

### **2. Folder Creation Process**
```
1. Invoice Manager/ (Main folder)
2. Invoices/ (Subfolder)
3. {email_address}/ (Email folder)
4. {month_year}/ (Month folder)
5. {vendor_name}/ (Vendor folder)
6. invoice.pdf (Actual file)
```

### **3. Inviter Detection Process**
```
1. Get email account by ID
2. Check if account was created through invitation
3. If invited: Find inviter from invitation record
4. If own account: Account owner is the inviter
5. Return inviter user information
```
